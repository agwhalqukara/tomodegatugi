His films have grossed over $3.5 billion in North America and over $10.5 billion worldwide, making him one of the world’s highest-grossing and highest-paid actors. He aspired to play professional football but went undrafted in the 1995 NFL Draft.</p><p>After accepting an athletic scholarship to play at the University of Miami, Dwayne Johnson became a member of the 1991 national championship team, but largely spent his four college football years in backup roles behind elite players, including future NFL player and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Warren Sapp.</p><p>Following his graduation, Dwayne Johnson signed with the Calgary Stampeders but was cut from the team in his first season. In 1996, his father Rocky, a longtime professional wrestler, assisted in helping him secure a contract with the WWF. Dwayne Johnson quickly rose to global prominence, aided by a gimmick he employed as a charismatic trash talker.</p><p>Dwayne Johnson left WWE in 2004 and returned in 2011 as a part-time performer until 2013, making sporadic appearances until retiring in 2019. A 10-time world champion, including the promotion’s first of African-American descent, he is also a two-time Intercontinental Champion, a five-time Tag Team Champion, the 2000 Royal Rumble winner, and WWE’s sixth Triple Crown champion.

In 2016 he voiced Maui in the Disney animated film Moana (2016). His role as Luke Hobbs in the Fast & Furious films, beginning with Fast Five (2011), helped the franchise become one of the highest-grossing in film. Dwayne Johnson also stars in the Jumanji films, appearing in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017) and Jumanji: The Next Level (2019), and voices Bark Kent / Krypto / Superdog, Anubis, and Teth-Adam / Black Adam in the animated film DC League of Super-Pets (2022), before starring as the latter in the live-action superhero film Black Adam (2022).</p><p>Dwayne Johnson produced and starred in the HBO comedy-drama series Ballers (2015–2019), and the autobiographical sitcom Young Rock (2021). In 2000, He released his autobiography, The Rock Says, which was a New York Times bestseller. In 2012, he co-founded the entertainment production company Seven Bucks Productions and is co-owner of the XFL a professional American football league, which he acquired from WWE owner Vince McMahon for $15 million in 2020. In 2016 and 2019, Time named Dwayne Johnson one of the world’s most influential people.</p><p>Dwayne Johnson has been listed as one of the all-time greatest professional wrestlers as well as one of the top draws in wrestling history. He holds the record for most Raw shows main-event in one year (38 in 2000), most SmackDown shows main-event in one year (36 in 2000) and tied with Stone Cold Steve Austin (in 2001) for most PPV shows main events in one year (12 in 2000).</p><p>In recognition of his service to the Samoan people, and because he is a descendant of Samoan chiefs, Dwayne Johnson was given the noble title of Seiuli (meaning the son of Malietoa [Alo o Malietoa]) by Malietoa Tanumafili II during his visit there on August 9, 2004. He became a Canadian citizen through his father’s birth and citizenship there in 2009.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Dwayne Johnson’s children?</h2><p>Dwayne Johnson is a father of 3.
