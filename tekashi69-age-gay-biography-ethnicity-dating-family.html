Interestingly, his musical influences didn’t start with rapping.&nbsp;He grew up listening to heavy metal bands like&nbsp;</span><span>Promenade Parkway</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>All That Remains.</span></p><p><span>Daniel’s life was about to get worse when his father died.&nbsp;He was only 13 at the time and had to work to support his mother.&nbsp;He became many things, including a bus boy, working in a bodega, and peddling weed.&nbsp;By then he had already dropped out of school in the 8th grade when he was expelled.&nbsp;Luckily, it didn’t turn into a life of crime.&nbsp;After being inspired by rapper RondoNumbaNine, and some of his friends.&nbsp;His professional career started with him working with Bodega Bamz who had nothing but praise for the newcomer.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Musical career</span></strong></h2><p><span>He was known early in his career for creating well-thought-out music videos with crazy outfits, visual effects, and outstanding low-budget themes.&nbsp;These efforts contributed enormously to its success.</span></p><p><span>6ix9ine’s early singles – like&nbsp;</span><span>Yokai, Hellsing Station</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Gummo –</span><span>&nbsp;created something of a movement.&nbsp;They have received millions of views and listening on YouTube and SoundCloud respectively.&nbsp;</span><span>Gummo</span><span>&nbsp;notably on the Billboard Hot 100. Since&nbsp;</span><span>Gummo,</span><span>&nbsp;two other songs&nbsp;</span><span>Kooda</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Keke</span><span>&nbsp;have also found their way to the Billboard Top 100.</span></p><p><span>Considering when his songs started buzzing, Teka $hi69 was a latecomer to SoundCloud and YouTube platforms.&nbsp;His lack of an official account on these platforms forced him to post videos exclusively through&nbsp;</span><span>F*ckthem,</span><span>&nbsp;a Slovak label.</span></p><p><span>In the spring of 2017, he embarked on his first European tour and built his SoundCloud following to over 180,000 subscribers and counting.&nbsp;He also posted&nbsp;</span><span>Gummo</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Kooda’s videos.&nbsp;Gummo</span><span>&nbsp;was produced by Pi’erre Bourne and has been viewed over 100 million times since its release on October 8, 2017. On December 3, 2018, the song&nbsp;</span><span>Kooda</span><span>&nbsp;followed suit with the song and music video.</span></p><p><span>January 14, 2018 saw the release of&nbsp;</span><span>Keke</span><span>&nbsp;on Youtube.&nbsp;He collaborated with&nbsp;</span><span>A boogie with a hoodie</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Fetty Wap</span><span>&nbsp;on the track.&nbsp;Tekashi69’s approach to music has been described as full-throated and hyper-aggressive.&nbsp;</span><span>It</span><span>&nbsp;was under the&nbsp;</span><span>EG Entertainment label,</span><span>&nbsp;a subsidiary of&nbsp;</span><span>Universal Music Group.&nbsp;</span><span>However, he would later sign a multi-million dollar deal for&nbsp;</span><span>Interscope Recordings.</span></p><p><span>One look at Tekashi will make his love for tattoos very obvious.&nbsp;His skin is littered with them, but one in particular stands out.&nbsp;He has the number “69” tattooed on his body more than 200 times, according to the rapper.&nbsp;He also wrote it on his face, in numbers and in words.&nbsp;According to the emcee, 69 is representative of his lifestyle.&nbsp;He is a strong supporter of&nbsp;</span><span>scumgang.&nbsp;</span><span>Scum means “society cannot understand me”.&nbsp;The idea of ​​his life philosophy is to stand up for people who can’t stand up for themselves.</span></p><p><span>An example of this is when he took part in the New York AIDS Walk with some of his friends who were suffering from the disease.&nbsp;Hernandez even has an “HIV” tattoo on his back in their honor.&nbsp;He is also making plans to manufacture and introduce his own line of condoms to the market.</span></p><p><span>Hernandez has had his bad times as well.&nbsp;His last straw was when he was arrested for selling heroin outside a store and beating up the store owner.&nbsp;He escaped a long sentence at the time because he was underage.&nbsp;He was also involved in a sexual abuse case with a minor in 2017.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Tekashi69 gay or dating?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Tekashi69 hasn’t really been in serious relationships that anyone knows.&nbsp;According to the rapper, he says that although he was in a chain of short-term relationships, he broke up with them all because they were never serious.&nbsp;However, he has a daughter from one of these relationships.&nbsp;Nothing more is known about the mother or the daughter.</span></p><p><span>In November 2017, rapper Trippie Redd, who once collaborated with 69, accused him on Instagram of attacking him at some point while he was in New York.&nbsp;He continued the slurs calling Tekashi “weird”, “racist”, and “gay”.&nbsp;In his response, Tekashi69 feigned concern for the rapper and asked him to go put an ice pack on his chin and stop pretending to be a gangster.</span></p><p><span>Trippie got livid and more specific with his cussing.&nbsp;He accused 69 of being gay porn star Apache Blu and even distributed pictures of Apache having sex.&nbsp;It was later proven that Apache and Tekashi were two different people.</span></p><p class=postsid
