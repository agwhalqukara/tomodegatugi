He has roots from Panama and Mexico and he quickly understood and valued his cultural background. <a href=# rel=noopener>Warner talks in an interview</a> about why he wears the Mexican flag. He said:</p><p>“Ever since I was born. My mom, her father is from Mexico and unfortunately he passed away when she was young, But my [Los Angeles] family from that Mexican side, they’ve always been involved in my life. And there was always Spanish speaking in my home. My mom, my grandmother, my dad, everybody speaks fluent Spanish. So yeah, it’s been a part of my life.”&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Who is in Fred Warner’s Family?</strong></h2><p>Fred Warner’s adored parents are Laura and Fred Warner Sr. Through his social media posts, the player frequently acknowledges how fortunate and happy he is to have the best mother in the entire world.

Happy anniversary my love.”&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Fred Warner’s Gridiron Journey: From a Seven-Year-Old Rookie to NFL Stardom</strong></h2><p>When he was seven, Warner started playing football after trying out different sports. Both he and his mom say that football helped him feel like he belonged to a group. Even though he looked up to many Chargers players, he was a fan of the Dallas Cowboys like his dad.</p><p>In high school at Mission Hills High School, he played football as a linebacker. He became a starting player when he was a junior with the varsity team. He was really good at being an outside linebacker and was even named the All-San Diego Section Defensive Player of the Year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fred-Warner.jpg><p>He also got recognized by USA Today and Cal-Hi Sports earning spots on the All-California First-team and the Cal-Hi Sports All-State First-team.
